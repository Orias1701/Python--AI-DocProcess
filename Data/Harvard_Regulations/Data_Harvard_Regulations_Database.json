      "Beginning in the classroom with exposure to new ideas, new ways of understanding, and new ways of knowing, students embark on a journey of intellectual transformation. Through a diverse living environment, where students live with people who are studying different topics, come from different walks of life, and have evolving identities, intellectual transformation is deepened, and conditions for social transformation are created. From this we hope that students will begin to fashion their lives by gaining a sense of what they want to do with their gifts and talents, assessing their values and interests, and learning how they can best serve the world."

In addition, students must demonstrate competence in certain skills reflective of the complex demands of modern society (writing, quantitative reasoning with data, and facility with a language other than English) and achieve a satisfactory level of performance in their work. Each of these requirements is set forth in detail below. (For the S.B. degree requirements, see “Engineering Sciences,” in Fields of Concentration, https://handbook.college.harvard.edu/#fields.)

Students undertaking the S.B. degree who require additional time in the College in order to meet the requirements of that degree must petition the Engineering Undergraduate Committee by the appropriate deadline. Tuition for an additional term is charged at a per course rate. Ordinarily, students in an additional term are not eligible for College housing or financial aid. Before petitioning the Administrative Board or the Engineering Undergraduate Committee for an additional term, students should consult with their Resident Dean about their proposed academic program, tuition and fees, and eligibility for College housing and financial aid. The Administrative Board or the Engineering Undergraduate Committee will weigh the student’s academic record and performance in the community when considering these petitions.

There are two types of honors in the College: English honors (or departmental honors) are determined by the department, committee, School, or program that oversees the relevant concentration and are based solely on work done in the concentration; Latin honors (or College honors) are based on the entirety of the student record, and recommendations for Latin honors are made to the Governing Boards of the University by the FAS.",
      "The FAS recommends bachelor’s degrees for presentation to the Governing Boards of the University as follows: regular degree; cum laude on the basis of the student’s overall record; cum laude in a field; magna cum laude in a field; magna cum laude with highest honors in a field; or summa cum laude in a field. Faculty and concentration standards for honors may change without notice; both sets of standards must be met.",
      "All candidates for degrees with honors must have satisfactory letter grades (C– or higher) in a minimum of 96 letter-graded credits (prorated appropriately for students graduating with fewer than 128 credits passed at Harvard). Grade point averages are based on all completed lettergraded courses taken while at Harvard including all failed courses, courses taken for credit in Harvard Summer School, and by cross-registration only as appropriate (see “Grade Point Averages for Undergraduates”).",
      "The relevant concentration will determine the level of English honors, if any, for an undergraduate who completes the requirements for honors eligibility in that field. If departmental honors are awarded, the student may then be recommended to the College for a determination of Latin honors. Thus, the awarding of departmental honors for work in a concentration is a precondition for the recommendation by the College of Latin honors in a field. It is possible that a student who has completed the relevant requirements for honors in a concentration will have the student’s record judged unworthy of honors in the field but still worthy of a degree; such a student may then be recommended by the FAS for a regular degree, subject to the general regulations, or, if qualified, for the degree cum laude.

The instructor may also elect to give a makeup examination. The responsibility for such decisions rests with the instructor only, and not with the Office of the Dean or the Administrative Board.",
      "Although instructors are obligated to offer makeup exams only in the case of absence for the observance of a religious holiday, students who have obtained proper HUHS documentation of illness may not be penalized for their absence from hour and midterm examinations. The appropriate form must be signed by an HUHS medical professional and given to the student’s Resident Dean, who will write the student a letter that acknowledges receipt of the HUHS form. This letter may be presented to the instructor as certification of the student’s illness.",

Sections and review sessions may take place during Reading Period as may class sessions that must be made up due to weather or other emergencies.",

Final papers, take-home exams, projects, presentations, and other culminating course assignments due after the end of regular classes must be due on or before the day of each course’s assigned exam/final deadline group, but no earlier than the fourth day of Reading Period. Final projects that include individual or group presentations may be scheduled beginning on the fourth day of Reading Period and may extend through the final examination and project period.* Short, regular assignments that address material covered in the last two weeks of classes (such as problem sets or response papers) may be due during the first three days of Reading Period.",
      "Regardless of whether a class meets during Reading Period, that time is an integral part of the term. Students are expected to remain in the immediate vicinity of Cambridge throughout this period.",
      "Each course will be assigned an exam/final deadline group (for more, see https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/exams/schedule) in order to spread out student deadlines and to establish grading due dates. While instructors may establish earlier deadlines per faculty legislation, the spirit of this legislation is to spread students’ final assignment deadlines across the entire exam period to avoid having all assignments due at the same time. If an instructor decides to use an earlier deadline, it is very important that students are well informed about this change from the posted deadline."

By accepting membership in the University, an individual joins a community ideally characterized by free expression, free inquiry, intellectual honesty, respect for the dignity of others, and openness to constructive change. The rights and responsibilities exercised within the community must be compatible with these qualities.",
      "The rights of members of the University are not fundamentally different from those of other members of society. The University, however, has a special autonomy and reasoned dissent plays a particularly vital part in its existence. All members of the University have the right to press for action on matters of concern by any appropriate means. The University must affirm, assure and protect the rights of its members to organize and join political associations, convene and conduct public meetings, publicly demonstrate and picket in orderly fashion, advocate, and publicize opinion by print, sign, and voice.",
      "The University places special emphasis, as well, upon certain values which are essential to its nature as an academic community. Among these are freedom of speech and academic freedom, freedom from personal force and violence, and freedom of movement. Interference with any of these freedoms must be regarded as a serious violation of the personal rights upon which the community is based. Furthermore, although the administrative processes and activities of the University cannot be ends in themselves, such functions are vital to the orderly pursuit of the work of all members of the University. Therefore, interference with members of the University in performance of their normal duties and activities must be regarded as unacceptable obstruction of the essential processes of the University. Theft or willful destruction of the property of the University or of its members must also be considered an unacceptable violation of the rights of individuals or of the community as a whole.",
      "Moreover, it is the responsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an atmosphere in which violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes by which these rights are fully assured. In particular, it is the responsibility of officers of administration and instruction to be alert to the needs of the University community; to give full and fair hearing to reasoned expressions of grievances; and to respond promptly and in good faith to such expressions and to widely expressed needs for change. In making decisions which concern the community as a whole or any part of the community, officers are expected to consult with those affected by the decisions. Failures to meet these responsibilities may be profoundly damaging to the life of the University. Therefore, the University community has the right to establish orderly procedures consistent with imperatives of academic freedom to assess the policies and assure the responsibility of those whose decisions affect the life of the University.",
      "No violation of the rights of members of the University, nor any failure to meet responsibilities, should be interpreted as justifying any violation of the rights of members of the University.

The Administrative Board’s authority to handle the routine College administrative and disciplinary matters derives directly from the Faculty. All meetings and discussions of the Administrative Board are confidential. The Administrative Board includes both teaching members of the Faculty and senior administrators. However, Resident Deans make up the majority of the membership and provide students with a direct link to the Administrative Board.",
      "Established procedures and practices guide the Administrative Board’s work and decisions, taking into account the Administrative Board’s understanding of the student’s particular circumstances. These include a student’s option to reconsider or appeal a decision; the opportunity to meet personally with a subcommittee of the Administrative Board in some disciplinary cases; the option to have present during a personal appearance at the subcommittee meeting an advisor in addition to one’s Resident Dean; the ability to take up very routine matters with the Registrar or House and Dean of Students offices, among other things.",
      "The FAS has established procedures for investigating violations of the University’s Policies on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment; however, the Administrative Board remains responsible for College student discipline. Any disciplinary proceedings against a College student based on allegations of a violation of the policy must be conducted in a manner consistent with the University procedures. The disciplinary procedures that apply to allegations of sexual or gender-based harassment brought against any undergraduate student may be found in full at the Office for Gender Equity’s website (https://oge.harvard.edu/policies-procedures).",
      "A student may ask that any decision of the Administrative Board be reconsidered provided that new materially relevant information becomes available or there is reasonable evidence of a procedural error. A student has the option to appeal some disciplinary decisions of the Administrative Board to the Faculty Council. Information on this process may be obtained from the student’s Resident Dean, the Secretary of the Administrative Board, or the Secretary of the Faculty. Appeals involving cases of sexual or gender-based harassment are described in the University Procedures as well as in the FAS Procedures."

    "Content": [
      "It should be noted that students are considered in good standing when they are not on probation and/or have not been required to withdraw, dismissed, or expelled from the College for either academic or disciplinary reasons. Warnings and admonitions do not affect a student’s good standing.",
      "In disciplinary cases, if the Administrative Board determines that wrongdoing occurred, it may take the following actions: Requirement to Complete an Educational Program: A requirement to successfully complete an educational program. This requirement may also be appended to any of the other actions listed below.",
      "Warn or Admonish: A reprimand to a student whose behavior violates the rules or standards of conduct of the community. A warning becomes part of the student’s official record, but is not considered a formal disciplinary action.",
      "Disciplinary Probation: A strong warning to a student whose conduct gives serious cause for concern. Probation is a formal disciplinary action of the College and becomes part of the student’s official record.",
      "During the period of time (to be specified by the Administrative Board) that a student is on probation, any further instance of misconduct will cause the Administrative Board to seriously consider requiring the student to withdraw from the College. Students on probation must be especially conscientious about their behavior and responsibilities. If the offense is related to participation in extracurricular activity, the Administrative Board may at its discretion restrict such participation; in cases in which management of time appears to contribute to the problem, the Administrative Board may require that the student obtain the Administrative Board’s permission for participation in each individual activity. The Administrative Board may also attach additional requirements to probation. A student’s failure to amend their conduct so as to meet the standards of this community is a grave matter, ordinarily leading to further disciplinary action, including requirement to withdraw. Students placed on disciplinary probation are ordinarily relieved of probation at the end of a set period of time (specified by the Administrative Board in its decision) if they have maintained satisfactory conduct. Students on probation may not receive a degree until they have been relieved of probation by the Administrative Board.",
      "Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary Reasons: Action taken in serious disciplinary cases indicating that the student’s behavior is unacceptable in this community. Requirement to withdraw is a formal disciplinary action of the College and becomes part of the student’s official record. Requirement to withdraw ordinarily is effective immediately upon vote of the Administrative Board. However, the Board may consider mitigating circumstances and delay the effective date of the requirement to withdraw. For example, the Administrative Board may decide to allow the student to complete the current term’s coursework and begin their separation at the end of the term.",
      "For students who have been required to withdraw, the rules regarding financial aid and financial obligations (housing fees, food, etc.) are the same as for undergraduates who go on leave of absence (see “Students’ Financial Obligations”). Students who are required to withdraw from the University are not entitled to an identification card until they have been officially readmitted (see also “Harvard University Identification Cards”).",
      "A student who is required to withdraw for disciplinary reasons is not in good standing until readmitted, and may not participate in any academic exercises or extracurricular activities. Students may not receive a degree until they have been readmitted to good standing in the College. In order to be readmitted, the student ordinarily must have been away from the College for at least one but ordinarily two or more full terms and must have shown an acceptable record of performance during a substantial period (at least six consecutive months) of regular employment. Employment must be full time, paid, supervised, and evaluated, and not in a business owned or controlled by the student’s family. Without exception, students who have been required to withdraw must petition the Administrative Board to be readmitted to the College, and the Administrative Board’s decision will depend on its judgment of the student’s readiness to rejoin the College community (see also “Readmission after Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary or Academic Reasons”). A student who has twice been required to withdraw from the College will ordinarily not be readmitted.",
      "No student who for disciplinary reasons has been required to withdraw for the second and final time or dismissed from Harvard College may ordinarily enroll in the Harvard Summer School or in the Extension School.",
      "Dismissal: Action taken in serious disciplinary cases whereby a student’s connection with the University is ended by vote of the Faculty Council. (The action taken by the Administrative Board is a vote of requirement to withdraw with a recommendation to the Faculty Council that the student be dismissed.) Dismissal does not necessarily preclude a student’s return, but readmission is granted rarely and only by vote of the Faculty Council. A dismissed student is not in good standing until readmitted.",
      "Expulsion: The most extreme disciplinary action possible. It signifies that the student is no longer welcome in the community. Expulsion must be voted by the Faculty Council. (The action taken by the Administrative Board is a vote of requirement to withdraw with a recommendation to the Faculty Council that the student be expelled.) A student who is expelled can never be readmitted and restored to good standing.",
      "In cases of academic review the Administrative Board can take any of the following actions: Academic Probation: a serious warning to a student whose academic performance for the term is unsatisfactory. Academic probation is a formal action taken by the Registrar on behalf of the Administrative Board and becomes part of the student’s official record.",
      "During the time that a student is on academic probation, any further instance of unsatisfactory academic progress will cause the Administrative Board to give serious consideration to requiring the student to withdraw from the College, ordinarily for two terms. A student on probation must attend all classes and be especially conscientious about all academic responsibilities. If the unsatisfactory academic record is related to participation in extracurricular activity, the Administrative Board may at its discretion restrict participation; in cases in which management of time appears to be the problem, the Administrative Board may require the student to obtain the Administrative Board’s permission for participation in each individual extracurricular activity. The Administrative Board may also attach additional requirements to probation. Failure of the student to resume satisfactory progress toward the degree is a grave matter and will ordinarily result in requirement to withdraw.",
      "student placed on probation for academic reasons is relieved of probation at the end of the next completed term if the record is satisfactory (including the passing of at least three courses). Students on probation may not receive a degree until they have been relieved of probation.",
      "Requirement to Withdraw for Academic Reasons: formal action of the College that becomes part of the student’s official record and that may be taken in the following circumstances reflecting the Administrative Board’s judgment that the record indicates that the student should be given time to reassess academic goals and plans: In the case of a student who has failed to have a satisfactory record for two consecutive terms.",
      "At any return of grades in the case of any student, whether or not previously on probation, whose record fails to meet the minimum requirements (see “Minimum Requirements”).",
      "In the case of serious neglect of work followed by an unsatisfactory record in any term, even though the student has met the minimum requirements.",
      "Students who have been required to withdraw for academic reasons should consult closely with their Resident Dean regarding financial aid and financial obligations (housing fees, food, etc.), which vary in certain respects from the obligations for undergraduates who go on leave of absence or who are required to withdraw for disciplinary reasons. Students who are required to withdraw from the University are not entitled to an identification card until they have officially been readmitted (see also “Harvard University Identification Cards”).",
      "student who is required to withdraw for academic reasons is not in good standing, and may not participate in any academic exercises or extracurricular activities. Students may not receive a degree until they have been readmitted and are in good standing in the College. At the end of the period of withdrawal, the student may be readmitted on (academic) probation, and relieved of (academic) probation at the end of that term provided the record is satisfactory (including the passing of at least three courses). In order to be readmitted, the student ordinarily must have been away from the College for at least one but ordinarily two or more full terms and must have shown an acceptable record of performance during a substantial period (at least six consecutive months) of full-time paid employment. Employment must be full time, paid, supervised, and evaluated, and not in a business owned or controlled by the student’s family.",
      "Without exception, students who have been required to withdraw must petition the Administrative Board to be readmitted to the College, and the Administrative Board’s decision will depend on its judgment of the student’s readiness to rejoin the College community (see also “Readmission after Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary or Academic Reasons”). A student who has twice been required to withdraw from the College will ordinarily not be readmitted.",
      "Should a first unsatisfactory record result from especially compelling and well-documented extenuating circumstances, the Administrative Board could decide to Take No Action and Warn students about their academic record instead of placing them on academic probation. However, an unsatisfactory record remains so regardless of the action taken by the Administrative Board.",
      "Therefore, all students who have an unsatisfactory record must take care to ensure that they earn all satisfactory grades during their next term in the College or a second unsatisfactory record may result in a requirement to withdraw.",
      "Although Exclusion from a Course is an action the Administrative Board will have taken prior to academic review, such evidence of neglect of work resulting in a failing grade weighs heavily in the Administrative Board’s consideration of and response to unsatisfactory records. (See “Exclusion from a Course”.)"

In all such cases the student must petition the Administrative Board to be readmitted to the College, and the Administrative Board’s decision will depend on its judgment of the student’s readiness to resume studies and to rejoin the College community.",

They must also meet any special requirements set by the Administrative Board or Honor Council and described in the letter sent them by the Resident Dean when they were required to withdraw. Examples of such additional, special requirements are a specified level of achievement in a session of the Harvard Summer School, and more than two terms spent away from the College and the Harvard campus. In certain cases, a student may also be requested to consult with Harvard University Health Services prior to return. The Administrative Board will not ordinarily approve the return of a student for the fall term whose experience in the Harvard Summer School in the previous summer has been unsuccessful or unsatisfactory.

Those planning to return to the College after an absence of five or more years will not ordinarily be eligible for scholarship aid from institutional sources. Petitions to return after an interval of five or more years must include evidence of financial resources necessary to meet all College expenses."

Two situations that routinely call for close coordination and consultation between HUHS and the College involve relief or accommodations for students experiencing difficulties, and leave of absence considerations. A student with a medical illness or exhibiting behavior that affects functioning may need professional evaluation of the condition to determine the appropriateness of temporary or ongoing arrangements, relief or exception to academic requirements, or accommodations, until adequate functioning is restored. In response to a request from a student’s Resident Dean or the DAO, HUHS clinicians may evaluate a student’s condition and make recommendations to the College. In making such recommendations, HUHS clinicians will not ordinarily disclose information they know independently about a student’s medical or mental health condition without the student’s consent and, in all cases, will not disclose information about the student that is not relevant to the recommendations."

      "The College, in consultation with the affected student, determines whether an injured or ill student, or a student exhibiting disruptive behavior, may continue in residence, and whether the student may return to residence after a short or longer-term absence due to accident, illness, or behavioral disturbance. In situations where a student’s medical illness or behavioral disturbance raises concerns about the practicality and appropriateness of the student’s residence in a dormitory or House, the College values the expert advice of HUHS and DAO in reaching its informed decision on the student’s remaining in or returning to residence at the College.",
      "Questions about a student’s residence (as opposed to enrollment) most often arise after a significant illness or injury that requires short- or longer-term follow-up care, but may also be prompted by situations in which a student seriously disrupts others in the residential community, or requires sustained services or monitoring beyond the capacity of a college to provide or beyond the standard of care that can be expected of a college health service. Such situations include — but are not limited to — the following: Any head injury.",
      "Any injury or illness that affects vision, hearing, speech, memory, balance, physical mobility, or manual dexterity.",
      "Any illness for which treatment includes medications not readily self-administered, or that requires special equipment for self-administration (IVs, for example).",
      "Any physical or mental illness whose behavioral manifestations have significantly affected roommates or others in the community, or pose a threat to the individual or community safety as assessed by HUHS clinicians.",

      "After a hospitalization or emergency room visit by one of its students that raises serious concerns about the student’s health or well-being, or in other circumstances that raise serious concerns about the student’s health or well-being and reasonably call into question their ability to function as a student in the Harvard College environment, Harvard College ordinarily will not permit that student to return to residence and enrollment or participation in any Harvard-related programs or activities before making its own assessment of the suitability of the student’s return. (See “Procedure for Notice and Consultation”). To better inform that assessment, students are expected to notify both Harvard College and HUHS or any hospitalization or emergency department visit. HUHS can be notified by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at 617-495-5711.",
      "Reason for Policy An important consideration in the College’s decision whether a student may continue in or return to residence is the impact of the student’s presence on the community. A student who is injured, ill, or exhibiting disturbing or disruptive behavior may require ongoing care. Serious alcohol- or drug-related problems in particular have the potential to disrupt dormitory life and life in the academic community significantly and impair a student’s ability to function academically and socially. Harvard College regards as unreasonable the expectation that roommates, suitemates, friends, or residential staff will take on health care responsibilities for other students.",

      "In such circumstances, officers of the College will consult with clinicians at HUHS and/or, if the student has been treated elsewhere, clinicians at other facilities or in private practice, ordinarily with the student’s permission. Depending on all of the relevant circumstances, such consultation may be initiated either by appropriate officers of the College or by clinicians at HUHS. Notice that a student has been hospitalized or treated in an emergency department of an area hospital may prompt the College to begin a process of consultation through which it will decide whether and under what circumstances the student may continue in or return to dormitory or House residence (see “Confidentiality and Consent”).",
      "The College may also independently decide that, based on its observations or other information it has about a student, it should initiate the process of consultation with HUHS clinicians, which may include ascertaining whether that student has been hospitalized or treated by an emergency department. Consultation will be focused on general information regarding concerns raised by the student’s condition or behavior and requirements for continued care, in order to facilitate the College’s decision about the student’s capacity to maintain residence. Neither the student’s medical nor mental health record will be available to officers of the College. College officers, who may consult with other affected students and responsible staff (only as necessary and in accordance with respect for the individual student’s right to privacy), will then determine whether it is appropriate for the student to continue in or return to residence.",
      "An important consideration in the College’s decision whether a student may continue in or return to residence is the impact of the student’s presence on the community. The College regards as unreasonable the expectation that roommates, suitemates, friends, or residential staff will take on health care responsibilities for other students. Therefore, the College will consider unacceptable any return-to-residence plan that requires other students to monitor a student’s condition or provide care.",
      "Any student may refuse to allow consultation between their clinician(s) and officers of the College, but a refusal to allow consultation will not prevent the College from meeting its obligation to reach a decision regarding a student’s return to or continuation in residence. In some circumstances, the level of care recommended by clinicians may cause the College temporarily to change a student’s place of residence or to deny residence, if in the judgment of College officers the necessary and recommended care cannot appropriately be provided in a student residential setting or is beyond the capacity and purpose of the College to provide. Since appropriate residential accommodations and follow-up treatment take time to arrange, students who have been hospitalized should expect that consultation between clinicians and officers of the College will need to occur at least 24 hours prior to a student’s anticipated return to residence. Both clinicians and College officers will make every effort to resolve questions promptly and, in case of disagreement, to discuss issues immediately and openly with the affected student. Ordinarily, consultation will occur between the student’s attending clinician, the relevant HUHS clinician coordinating the case, and the student’s Resident Dean.",
      "In the event of disagreement, the HUHS clinician, the Resident Dean, or the student may ask that the appropriate Chief of Service at HUHS, the Dean of Students, or another senior College official designated by the Dean of Harvard College be involved. While HUHS clinicians and officers of the College will endeavor to respect the wishes of students regarding treatment recommendations and residential arrangements, the final determination about residence in Harvard housing will rest with the Dean of Harvard College."

    "Content": [
      "The College’s concern for students’ well-being encompasses the preservation of a safe environment and the proactive provision of health resources. The College communicates to all students the availability of psychological, psychiatric, and medical resources at HUHS for consultation, assessment, education, intervention, and possible ongoing treatment of behavioral disturbances arising from alcohol or drug abuse and other health issues. The College encourages students’ voluntary use of these confidential resources, and proctors, tutors, and Resident Deans routinely refer students to them or remind students of their availability.",
      "Occasionally, a student having potentially significant problems with the use of alcohol or the use of drugs, or having other health issues, does not voluntarily seek help to ameliorate them. These problems often become apparent to residential staff, Harvard police, or other University officers in the form of significant disruption of, for example, life in the residential community, disturbance of personal relationships, or threats to the safety of individuals or of property. A student’s behavioral problems resulting from substance use or a psychological disorder also may recur or persist over time, and thus may pose a significant threat to the student’s own health and well-being or the health and well-being of others. The College may initiate disciplinary proceedings in response to the student’s conduct. In addition, regardless of whether disciplinary proceedings are initiated, if a student has not voluntarily sought help, the student’s Resident Dean may formally refer the student to HUHS for evaluation, ideally in consultation and cooperation with the student.",
      "Health Concerns The use of illicit drugs and the misuse of alcohol or prescription drugs are potentially harmful to health. In particular, synthetically-produced drugs often have unpredictable emotional and physical side effects that constitute an extreme health hazard. Students should also weigh the seriousness of potential loss of function that may come from ingesting illicit drugs or too much alcohol. Because of the considerable hazards involved in drug and alcohol use, administrative, medical, and psychiatric help for students having alcohol or other drug problems are available on a confidential basis from the Center for Wellness and Health Promotion (CWHP) and other departments within HUHS, as well from Resident Deans and other officers of the University.",
      "Referrals for Interventions/Treatment Regarding Alcohol and/or Other Drug Abuse The following procedures outline the process for obtaining consultation for a Harvard College student whose known or suspected alcohol or drug use is affecting the student’s ability to function effectively as a student and/or as a member of the Harvard community. Referrals may be made by a Resident Dean based on incidents that come to the Resident Dean’s attention or as a result of Administrative Board action. Interventions with the Center for Wellness and Health Promotion are not intended to take the place of routine advising conversations between Resident Deans and students. Rather, they provide an opportunity for structured consultation, particularly for those students who may not view their substance use or related negative consequences as problematic. The procedures and resources outlined below focus on the health and safety of the student.",
      "Grounds for Referral Any of the following conditions may lead a Resident Dean or the Administrative Board to refer a student for an intervention with CWHP about the student’s known or suspected alcohol or drug use: A medical complication resulting from alcohol or drug use (e.g., aspiration, traumatic accident, alcohol poisoning, seizure, blackout, overdose, infection from intravenous use).",
      "Repeated incidents related to alcohol or drug use that require medical intervention.",
      "A serious behavioral or disciplinary problem related to alcohol or drug use.",
      "Disruption in the residential community or academic environment related to alcohol or drug use.",
      "Academic difficulties or other problems in functioning related to misuse of alcohol or drugs.",
      "Repeated minor infraction of rules regarding alcohol or drug use.",
      "Referral Letter The Resident Dean makes the referral for an intervention in writing to the student with a copy to the Prevention Specialist/Health Educator at CWHP and a copy for the student’s College file. The referral letter frames the referral as a consultation regarding the student’s alcohol or drug use, rather than as treatment or counseling. The referral letter clearly communicates that the student is expected to schedule the appointment(s) with an CWHP staff member and complete the designated program within a specified time of receiving the letter (ordinarily, no more than three weeks) and is to comply with all of the provider’s recommendations. It is also made clear in the referral letter that, should the student choose to decline the referral, the Resident Dean and senior officers of the House and the College will assess, on the basis of available information, whether it is appropriate for the student to continue in residence and to remain enrolled in the College. For more information on this topic, see the sections “Policies Governing Enrollment and Residency,” and “Consultations and Interventions Due to Alcohol or Drug Abuse or Other Health Issues.”",
      "CHWP Interventions The CWHP staff member will meet with the student individually either for an individual consultation or for two BASICS (BASICS stands for “Brief Alcohol Screening & Intervention for College Students”) sessions. Both interventions involve discussing the student’s substance use history and circumstances surrounding the referral, and CHWP staff may then direct the student to further resources. Resources include, but are not limited to, alcohol education (individual consultations or BASICS), further assessment, ongoing counseling, and/or substance abuse groups, which are offered by CAMHS. It should also be noted that support is available from HUHS with or without a referral from a University officer; students can also access CWHP services on their own.",
      "Monitoring Student Compliance with Interventions for Alcohol/Substance Use During the intervention, the CWHP staff member will seek permission from the student to contact the appropriate College officer (typically, the student’s Resident Dean) regarding the student’s attendance and participation in the session(s) and what further action, if any, is recommended. Authorized release forms are used as necessary.",
      "It is the responsibility of the Resident Dean, in consultation with the Prevention Specialist/Health Educator of CWHP and other senior College officials, to follow up with the student upon notification of a student’s failure to comply with the recommended assessment, intervention, or treatment.",
      "In the referral, the Resident Dean will communicate both to the student and to the clinician the basis of the College’s concerns, and will make note of the referral in the student’s file. Should the student choose to decline the referral, then the Resident Dean and senior officers of the College will assess on the basis of available information whether it is appropriate for the student to continue in residence or remain enrolled in the College. The Dean of Harvard College may, if the Dean deems it necessary and appropriate, place such a student on an involuntary leave of absence from the College. (See “Involuntary Leaves.”)"

In this case, the Resident Dean will propose a formal agreement with the student, which will summarize the reasons for the College’s concern and the requirement that the College be informed in the event that the student should fail to keep appointments, interrupt counseling against clinical advice, or otherwise undermine the therapeutic process.

In this instance too, the Dean of Harvard College may, if the Dean deems it necessary and appropriate, place such a student on an involuntary leave of absence from the College (see “Involuntary Leaves”).

      "To be useful, students’ records must be accurate and complete. The officials who maintain these records are those in charge of the functions reflected in the records and the offices where the records are kept. These ordinarily include the Registrar of FAS, as well as certain officers of the GSAS and Harvard College, including, for example, the Divisional Deans, the Chairs of academic departments and/or concentration committees, the Director of Admissions, the Dean of Students, the Resident Deans, and the Head Tutors or Directors of Undergraduate Studies. All students have access to their own education records and may contribute to them if they feel there is need for clarification. Students wishing access to their education records should contact the Registrar’s Office. Ordinarily, students are asked to submit a written request that identifies the specific record or records they wish to inspect. Access will be given within 45 days from receipt of the request. When a record contains information about more than one student, the student requesting access may inspect and review only the portion of the record relating to themselves.",
      "Students also are not permitted to view letters and statements of recommendation to which they waived their right of access, or that were placed in their file before January 1, 1975.",
      "Students should direct any questions they have about the accuracy of records to the person in charge of the office where the records are kept. If questions still remain, the matter may be referred to the Associate Registrar for Operations in the Registrar’s Office. Should it be necessary, a hearing may be held to resolve challenges concerning the accuracy of records in those cases where informal discussions have not satisfactorily settled the questions raised."

      "The FAS regards the following information as “directory information,” that is, information that, under FERPA, can be made available to the general public: full name; reported date of birth; dates of attendance; concentration; class year; digitized image (please note that while Harvard classifies photos and images as directory information, these are rarely released to parties outside the University without the student’s permission); local or campus residence address and telephone number; University email address; secondary school (for College students); undergraduate college (for GSAS students); home town or city at the time the application for admission was filed by the student; original class at time of matriculation; degree candidate status; date of graduation (actual or expected); degree(s) received with field of concentration and level of honors granted (if any); department of study; University prizes, fellowships, and similar honors awarded; and, in certain cases, students’ and parents’ or guardians’ home addresses and telephone numbers. For student employees: job title, teaching appointment (if applicable), employing department, and dates of employment. For Harvard College, directory information also includes House affiliation, and height and weight of members of athletic teams.",
      "Please note that Harvard University’s definition of directory information, found at http://provost.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/ferpa_overview.pdf may include elements in addition to those used by FAS, and that requests for directory information received at the University level thus may result in disclosure of such additional elements.",
      "Students may direct FAS not to disclose their directory information, usually known as putting in place a “FERPA Block.” To do so, a student must inform the Registrar’s Office in person and sign a form requesting that the information be blocked. Students should be aware of the possible consequences of putting in place a FERPA Block, such as missed mailings, messages, and announcements, non-verification of enrollment or degree status, and non-inclusion in the Harvard Commencement booklet. Students who have previously chosen to put in place a FERPA Block may decide to reverse this decision, also by informing the Registrar’s Office in writing."

For example, disclosure is permitted to Harvard officials with a legitimate educational interest in the records, meaning that the person needs the information in order to fulfill their professional responsibilities, including instructional, supervisory, advisory, administrative, academic or research, staff support or other duties. “Harvard officials” include faculty; administrators; clerical employees; professional employees; Harvard University Health Services staff members; Harvard University Police Department officers; agents of the University, such as independent contractors performing functions on behalf of FAS or the University; members of Harvard’s governing boards; and students serving on an official FAS, College, GSAS, or University committee, or assisting another Harvard official in performing their tasks. A student’s education record also may be shared with parties outside the University under certain conditions, including, for example, in situations involving a health and safety emergency.",
      "In addition, the Registrar’s Office will forward a student’s education records to other agencies or institutions that have requested the records and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled so long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student’s enrollment or transfer.",
      "If either Harvard College or the GSAS finds that a student has committed a disciplinary violation involving a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, then FAS also may, if legally permitted and appropriate in the judgment of Harvard College or the GSAS, disclose certain information about the disciplinary case.",
