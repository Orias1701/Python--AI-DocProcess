   "Text": "Hazing is a crime punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. The Administrative Board of the College will consider all reports of hazing in the normal course of this oversight, taking disciplinary action in appropriate cases, and will report confirmed incidents to appropriate law enforcement officials. Where serious harm, or the potential for serious harm, has come to any person as a result of hazing by members of a student group, whether or not such group is officially recognized by the College (either on campus or off campus), and the individual or individuals directly responsible are not identified, the host or hosts of the event or activity will be held personally responsible. If the hosts are not identified, the officers of the organization will be held personally responsible. In considering such cases, the Administrative Board will apply the College’s help-seeking policy (see “Help-Seeking Policy”), and may consider as mitigating factors with respect to possible disciplinary action the efforts made by the hosts or officers to prevent the harmful or potentially harmful situation, as well as their cooperation with the College’s investigation of the situation.",
